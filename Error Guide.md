### Common Errors & Quick Fixes ðŸš¨

#### Error: No module named â€˜xxxxxxâ€™
Solution: Install that module!

```bash
!pip install xxxxxx
```

Example:
Error: No module named typeguard  
Solution:  
```bash
pip install typeguard  # Note: module name might differ from the package name!
```

#### Error: AttributeError: module 'sip' has no attribute 'setapi'
Solution: Oops! Let's downgrade matplotlib:
```bash
!pip install matplotlib==3.2
```

#### Error: ValueError: numpy.ndarray size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 88 from C header, got 80 from PyObject
Solution: Time for a little pycocotools reinstall magic:
```bash
pip uninstall pycocotools -y
pip install pycocotools
```

#### Error: ValueError: 'images' must have either 3 or 4 dimensions.
Solution: Try restarting your Jupyter Notebookâ€”your webcam might be taking a break. If you're using images, double-check your image name and path!

#### Error: error: (-2:Unspecified error) The function is not implemented. Rebuild the library with Windows, GTK+ 2.x or Cocoa support.
Solution: Let's fix this by reinstalling OpenCV and saying goodbye to opencv-headless:
```bash
pip uninstall opencv-python-headless -y
pip install opencv-python --upgrade
```

#### Error: KeyError: 'ThumbsDown' # YOUR LABEL HERE (in GenerateTFRecords)
Solution: Sounds like a label mismatch! Make sure your annotations match your label map exactlyâ€”case sensitivity counts!

#### Error: No module named 'cv2' when running a training script from the command line.
Solution: Donâ€™t forget to activate your virtual environment before running the command. Itâ€™s like turning on the lights before you work!

#### Error: When training, only the CPU is used and the GPU is ignored.
Solution: Make sure youâ€™ve got the right CUDA and cuDNN versions for your TensorFlow. Links to guides:
- [Windows](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows)
- [Linux/macOS](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source)

#### Error: CUBLAS_STATUS_ALLOC_FAILED or CUDNN_STATUS_ALLOC_FAILED
Solution: Your GPU's feeling a bit overwhelmedâ€”close all Python programs and stop your Jupyter Notebook to free up VRAM, then try again!



Feel free to tweak these as you like, but hopefully, this adds a bit of fun to troubleshooting! ðŸš€
